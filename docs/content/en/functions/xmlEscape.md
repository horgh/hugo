In the result `&` becomes `&amp;` and so on. It escapes characters with
special meaning in XML 1.0. If a character is not valid for XML 1.0, it
gets replaced with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).

```
{{ xmlEscape "Hugo & Caddy > Wordpress & Apache" }} â†’ "Hugo &amp; Caddy &gt; Wordpress &amp; Apache"
```
